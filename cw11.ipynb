    "To be able to use Euler's Method you need to be given the very first point of your function. This is usually done in differential equations as the initial condition. The initial condition can be thought of as the first element of $u$ or $u_0 = u(t_0)$ which will then also give you $f_0 = f(t_0,u_0)$. Then by knowing the initial and final $t$ and selecting a number of integration points you can determine your $\\Delta t$. You now have all of the pieces to get the very next point, in this case $u_1 = u(t_1)$. Then $u_1$ will be used again in this prescription to get $u_2$ with the very same $\\Delta t$ and so on. <br\\>\n",

    "$K_2$ is again a derivative at a certain point scaled by $\\Delta t$ (the derivative being the function in the differential equation).

The derivative is taken at a $t$ value that is shifted from the current value by a factor of $\\Delta t/2$ and at the Euler approximated next point.
